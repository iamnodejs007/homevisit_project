# homevisit_project

Homevisit is a fanstasy startup I created to learn the MEAN Stack.  The concept is an airbnb-like web app where people can earn extra cash by offering tours of their well-designed homes to other design fans.   It uses node.js, Express, Mongo DB (mongoose) and Angular 1.7 to create a single-page CRUD app on a RESTful API. Users can see all tours, see a single tour, create a new tour, update their tour, or delete their tour.   Future features include user authentication, client and server side form validation, and file upload via the npm multer package. 

Styling is still minimal but this will change. I use Bootstrap as the framework.
